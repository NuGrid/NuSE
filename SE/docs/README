useepp.tex 	contains the chapter include file. 
useepp-chapter.tex  the wrapper that allows you to compile the chapter include
		   file locally into this directory.

The nugrid.sty is slightly different here compared to the one in the
top level docs directory. If you have references get the ngastro bib
file from the docs directory and commit back to there.

Use 'runlatex' to compile. The chapter header has a different form if compiler into the book in docs or into the standalone se-chapter wrapper here:

% \chapter{\ndoctitle}   % uncomment this if compiled into book in docs directory
\ngtitle{\ndoctitle}     % uncomment this is compiled into chapter wrapper this directory

Make sure you uncomment the right line.
